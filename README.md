# Analog Systems and Lab (EE2019)

*This repository contains simulations done as part of the Analog Systems and Lab (EE2019) course at IIT Madras.*

## Project Overview
A Composite Analog System for Synchronized Light and Sound was implemented and analyzed through multiple simulation experiments using LTSpice.

## Contents
LTSpice simulation files for the experiments.

Required SPICE model files for accurate simulation.

## Requirements
LTSpice installed.

Some SPICE models used are not included by default in LTSpice. You will need to:

Download the provided model files from this repository.

Add them manually to LTSpice or include them directly in your simulation schematics.

## Credits

Developed as part of coursework at IIT Madras
